Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices by processing historical data and calculating technical indicators to capture patterns in the financial markets. Leveraging XGBoost regression models with hyperparameter tuning, the project aims to improve prediction accuracy on both equity and index data.

Key Features
Comprehensive Indicator Analysis: Extracts and calculates key indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, and more.
Efficient Model Training: Optimized model training with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
Flexible Data Processing: Capable of handling both equity and index datasets with customizable intervals.
Uses and Significance
This system serves as a powerful tool for analysts, investors, and researchers aiming to understand and forecast market behavior. By combining multiple technical indicators and utilizing robust machine learning techniques, this project offers insights that can guide decision-making in trading and investment.

How the Project Works
This project is organized into three main components:

Data Collection: Historical data is fetched using yfinance for specified intervals, allowing flexibility in periods for detailed market analysis.
Data Processing and Indicator Calculation: Core technical indicators like SMA, EMA, RSI, and MACD are calculated to capture market patterns.
Model Training and Prediction: XGBoost models are trained on the processed data to predict upcoming price trends.
Installation
Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required libraries with:

bash
Copy code
pip install yfinance pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost
Required Libraries

yfinance: For fetching historical financial data.
pandas: For data manipulation and processing.
numpy: For numerical operations.
scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation.
xgboost: For advanced regression modeling.
Directory Structure
Organize your project directory as follows:

kotlin
Copy code
â”œâ”€â”€ data                    (Folder for equity and index data files)
â”œâ”€â”€ equities.ipynb          (Notebook for processing and predicting equity data)
â”œâ”€â”€ indices.ipynb           (Notebook for processing and predicting index data)

Data Collection and Processing
Data Collection
Data is collected using the fetch_stock_data() function, which fetches historical stock data for specified intervals and periods using yfinance. It can handle multiple intervals, providing flexibility in market analysis.

Data Processing
The process_stock_data() function prepares the data by calculating key indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and more. These indicators provide insight into market trends, helping the model make informed predictions.

Model Training
To train the prediction model:

Load and preprocess the data using train_test_split for training and testing.
Train the XGBoost model with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to find the optimal parameters.
Model Architecture

The model utilizes XGBoost regression, a robust technique suited for time-series prediction with financial data. It uses gradient boosting to minimize errors and improve model accuracy.

Prediction and Evaluation
Open the respective notebook (equities.ipynb or indices.ipynb) to run predictions. Model performance can be evaluated using metrics such as R2 Score, and adjustments can be made to improve accuracy.

Future Plans
Expanding Functionality: Future improvements include testing additional machine learning models and incorporating real-time data for live predictions.
